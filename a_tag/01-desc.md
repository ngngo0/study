# `<a>` TAG 
interactive simple

## Definition:
The `<a>` tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.

The most important attribute of the `<a>` element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

An unvisited link is underlined and blue
A visited link is underlined and purple
An active link is underlined and red

### Usage:
Tip: If the `<a>` tag has no href attribute, it is only a placeholder for a hyperlink.

Tip: A linked page is normally displayed in the current browser window, unless you specify another target.

Tip: Use CSS to style links: CSS Links and CSS Buttons.

### Simple syntax:

```
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">
<img border="0" alt="W3Schools" src="logo_w3s.gif" width="100" height="100">
</a>

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools.com!</a>

<a href="#section2">Go to Section 2</a>

<a href="javascript:alert('Hello World!');">Execute JavaScript</a>
```

### My summary:

Use it for linking, or a placeholder for linking. Link things like images, or link to different parts of the page, or link to javascript(scary) using the href attribute.
