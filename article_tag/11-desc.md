# Article Tag
## block semantic

## Definition:
The <article> tag specifies independent, self-contained content.

An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site.

Potential sources for the <article> element:

Forum post
Blog post
News story
Note: The <article> element does not render as anything special in a browser. However, you can use CSS to style the <article> element (see example below).

### Simple syntax:
```
<article class="browser">
    <h2>Google Chrome</h2>
    <p>Google Chrome is a web browser developed by Google, released in 2008. Chrome is the world's most popular web browser today!</p>
</article>
```
### My summary:
A semantic tag, so really its just a matter of organizing it. It belongs in contexts like forum posts, blog post, news stories and anything article-y in nature. Can be used to increase readability and be used for organized styling.
